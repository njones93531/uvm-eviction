##This directory contains plotting scripts for visualizing fault data

#Python Scripts: 
 - density.py:
  - generates a variety of plots using one or more klogs as input. 
  - usage: density.py [-h] [-t] [-o OUTDIR] F [F ...]
 - big_violin_serial.py
  - reads multiple klogs and generates one side-by-side violin chart for each of four metrics. 
  - usage: big_violin_serial.py [-h] [-o OUTDIR] F [F ...]
 - polyfit.py
  - Reads one or more klogs of the same application and plots a polynomial fit of the scatter plots generated by density.py. Usually used to compare prefetching and no prefetching for the same application and problem size. 
  - usage: polyfit.py [-h] [-o OUTDIR] F [F ...]
 - density_table.py 
  - Reads one or more klogs and prints statistics about the metrics
  - usage: density_table.py [-h] [-t] F [F ...]
 - Fault.py (legacy)
  - Reads one klog file and prints statistics about other metrics
  - usage: Fault.py [-h] csv
 - faulttest.py
  - Reads one klog file and prints statistics about other metrics 
  - Usage: python script.py klog
 - faults_evictions_table.py
  - Reads one or more klogs and prints the number and percent of faults/evictions per allocation
  - usage: faults_evictions_table.py [-h] [-t] F [F ...]
 - fault_csv.py
  - Reads one or more klogs and prints a csv of statistics for plotting csv_vs_plots
  - usage: fault_csv.py [-h] [-p] F [F ...]
 - csv_vs_plots.py
  - Generates plots of x_column vs y_column from csv data generated by fault_csv.py
  - usage: csv_vs_plots.py [-h] [-l] [-o OUTDIR] [-x] [-a] [-y] input_file x_column y_column
 - faults_per_VABlock.py
  - Reads one klog and generates a figure that shows the distribution of faults per migration for each VABlock in an allocation
  - usage: faults_per_VABlock.py [-h] F outfile

#Julia Scripts:
 - precompiler.jl 
  - generates a .so file for a given system, which is required by other julia scripts 
  - usage: julia precompiler.jl
 - pattern_plot.jl
  - reads one klog file and generates a plot showing faults/evictions over time. 
  - julia --compile=all -03 --sysimage [.so file] ./pattern_plot.jl [-m marker] [-n outfile] klog [-s marker size] [-i plot title] [-t]
 - batch_plot.jl (unknown)
 - prefetch_plot.jl (unkown)
 - precompile_plots.jl (unkown)

#Bash Scripts: 
 - conclusion_five.sh
  - Generates the big violin plot for the conclusion of the ICS paper
 - csv_vs_plots_all.sh
  - Generates csv vs plots for every possible column of the csv. Requires an input
  - usage: ./csv_vs_plots.sh csv 
 - faults_evictions_table.sh
  - Generates faults_eviction table for every benchmark
 - faults_per_VABlock_all.sh
  - Generates faults_per_VABlock for every benchmark
 - mass_density_plots.sh
  - Generates density plots for every benchmark
 - mass_fault_csv.sh
  - Generates a fault csv containing data from every benchmark
 - mass_fault_data.sh
  - Generates fault data for every benchmark
 - mass_fault_plots.sh
  - Generates a fault plot for each benchmark
 - mass_polyfit_plots.sh
  - Generates polyfit plots comparing prefetching and no prefetching for every benchmark 
 - precompile.sh
  - Runs precompile.jl 
 - wc.sh
  - Prints the wc of each klog. Useful to avoid OOM errors. Threshold for 128GB of RAM is 60 million lines
